## Introduction Identification Types:

	Given an array find the sub array of size.
	In this technique, w are given an array or string , we need to identify 
	sub array or substring and we have to find the largest/maximum/longest/
	minimum in a range of k consecutive elements.
	
	This technique can be divided in to two types 
		a. Fix Size window (K given)
		b. Variable size window ( We need to find k)
	## General Format ##
		
		int i = 0;
		int j = 0;
		int windowSize = (j-i+1);
		
		while(j < k) {
			calculations
			if(windowsize < k) {
				j++;
			} else if(windowsize == k) {
				ans == calucation;
				j++;
			} else if(windowsize > k) {
				while(windowsize > k) {
					reverse calculation for i;
					i++;
				}
				j++;
			}
			return ans;
		}
		
### MaximumSumSubArrayOfSizeK_01
	Given a array of size n, find the sub array of size k, where sum is 	maximum
	IP: 	arr: {2, 3, 5, 3, 6, 8}
			k = 3;
	
	OP: 17
	
### FirstNegativeNumberInWindowSizeK_02
	Given a array of size n, find the first minimum in the sub array of size 	k.
	IP: 	arr: {12, -1, -7, 8, -15, 30, 28}
			k = 3
	OP:		{-1, -1, -7, -15, -15, 0}	

### CountOfOccurrenceOfAnagram_03
	Given a String and a pattern find all the anagram of the pattern is 	present in the string
	
	IP: String str = "fxoraxofxo";
		 String pattern = "fox";
	OP: 4	 

### MaximumOfAllSubArrayOfSizeK_04		
	Given an array, we have to find all the elements in the subarray of size 	k.
	IP: arr = [1, 3, -1, -3, 5, 3, 6 7];
		 k = 3;
	OP: {3, 3, 5, 5, 6, 7}	  
	
	Concepts:
	Here we can compare the consecutive elemens and we can update the max eleemnt.
	But once we delete the max element then we should have max eleemnt in remainin k-1 window.
	
### LargestSubArrayOfSumK_05
    Given an array, find the maximum subarray length whose sum is equal to a given sum.
    IP: arr = {4, 1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5};
        sum = 5
    OP: 4 (1+1+1+2)

### LargestSubStringWithKRepeatingChars_06
    Given a String find the largest substring with k repeated charcaters 

### LargestSubStringWithNoRepeatingCharacters_07
    Given a String find the largest substring with unique charcaters 

### MinimumWindowSubString_08
Input: s = "ADOBECODEBANC", t = "ABC"
Output: "BANC"
Explanation: The minimum window substring "BANC" includes 'A', 'B', and 'C' from string t.

### FruitInToBasket_10
Problem Statement #
    Given an array of characters where each character represents a fruit tree, 
    you are given two baskets and your goal is to put maximum number of fruits in each basket. 
    The only restriction is that each basket can have only one type of fruit.
    You can start with any tree, but once you have started you canâ€™t skip a tree.
    You will pick one fruit from each tree until you cannot, 
    i.e., you will stop when you have to pick from a third fruit type.

Write a function to return the maximum number of fruits in both the baskets.

Example 1:

Input: Fruit=['A', 'B', 'C', 'A', 'C']
Output: 3
Explanation: We can put 2 'C' in one basket and one 'A' in the other from the subarray ['C', 'A', 'C']
Example 2:

Input: Fruit=['A', 'B', 'C', 'B', 'B', 'C']
Output: 5
Explanation: We can put 3 'B' in one basket and two 'C' in the other basket.
This can be done if we start with the second letter: ['B', 'C', 'B', 'B', 'C']
