## Definition:
    The stratergy pattern defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one and makes them
    interchangeble. Stratergy lets the algorithm vary independently from clients that use it. 

    This is a type of Behavioral Design Pattern. 
    Behavioral design patterns are concerned with algorithms and 
    the assignment of responsibilities between objects.
