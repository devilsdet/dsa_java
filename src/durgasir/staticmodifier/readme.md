1. we can declare variables, method names as static.
2. We can not declare outer class as static class but we can declare inner class as non static class.
3. In case of instance variable, for every object a separate copy of the variable will be created. But in case of 
static variables a single copy of the variable will be  created at class level and shared by every object of that class.
4. Instance variables can not be accessed from static method directly, but we can access from instance area 
directly. We can access static variables from instance area and static area directly.
