### How to identify a DP Problem
    It is enhanced recursion.
        f(n)
    f(n-1) f(n-2)
    In Dp, they always ask for optimal(Minimum/Maximum/Longest/Largest)
    In DP, they always have a choice. If a recursive function makes two calls then there is a chance
    The parent problems of dp are
#### 1. 0/1 Knapsack (6)
#### 2. Unbounded knapsack (5)
#### 3. Fibonacci (7)
#### 4. Longest Common Subsequence (15)
#### 5. Longest Increasing Subsequence (10)
#### 6. Kadane's algorithm (6)
#### 7. Matrix Chain Multiplication (7)
#### 8. DP on trees (4)
#### 9. DP on  Grid (14)
#### 10. Others (5)
