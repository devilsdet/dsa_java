### ContainerWithMostWater_01

You are given an integer array height of length n. 
There are n vertical lines drawn such that the two endpoints of the ith line are (i, 0) 
and (i, height[i]).

Find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container, 
such that the container contains the most water.

Input: height = [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]
Output: 49
Explanation: The above vertical lines are represented by array [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]. 
In this case, the max area of water (blue section) the container can contain is 49.

### PairWithTargetSum_02
    Problem Statement:
        Given an array of sorted numbers and a target sum, 
        find a pair in the array whose sum is equal to the given target.
    IP: [1, 2, 3, 4, 6]

### RemoveDuplicates_03
    Problem Statement:
        Given an array of sorted numbers, remove all duplicates from it. You should not use any extra space; 
        after removing the duplicates in-place return the new length of the array.
    IP: [2, 3, 3, 3, 6, 9, 9]
    OP: 4
### SquaringASortedArray_04
    Problem Statement:
        Given a sorted array, 
        create a new array containing squares of all the number of the input array in the sorted order.
        Input: [-2, -1, 0, 2, 3]
        Output: [0, 1, 4, 4, 9]
