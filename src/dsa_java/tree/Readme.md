Binary Tree
===========================

Binary tree will have a node (value, left node, right node).

            a
           / \
          b   c 
         /\     \
        d  e     f
## Traversal
### DepthFirstSearch

Here we will traverse to the left side of the array and we will keep printing until the node doesnt have
any childs.
We have to use stacks here.

### BreadthFirstSearch

Here we will traverse the tree horizentally and print the tree.
We have to use queue here.
